**Abstract**:<br>Changes in gene expression have been proposed to play a major role in adaptive evolution. However, gene expression is highly context-dependent and very few studies have determined the influence of genetic and non-genetic effects on adaptive gene regulation in natural populations. Here, we utilize context-dependent allele-specific expression to characterize *cis* and *trans* changes underlying divergence in temperate and tropical house mice in two metabolic tissues under two thermal conditions. First, we show that gene expression divergence is pervasive between populations and across thermal conditions, with roughly 5-10% of genes exhibiting genotype-by-environment interactions. Second, we found that most intraspecific regulatory divergence was due to *cis*-regulatory changes that were stable across temperatures. In contrast, patterns of expression plasticity were largely attributable to *trans*-effects, which showed greater sensitivity to temperature. Nonetheless, we discovered a small subset of temperature-dependent *cis*-regulatory changes, thereby identifying loci underlying expression plasticity. Finally, we performed scans for selection in wild house mice to identify genomic signatures of rapid adaptation. Genomic outliers were enriched in genes with evidence for *cis*-regulatory divergence. Strikingly, these genes were associated with phenotypes that affected body weight and metabolism, identifying *cis*-regulatory changes as a mechanism for adaptive body size evolution between populations. Together, these results support the central role of *cis*-regulatory divergence in adaptive evolution over extremely short timescales.
