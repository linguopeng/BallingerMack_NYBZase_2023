abstract: |
  Gene regulation plays an important role in adaptive evolution, yet little is known how the environment, tissue-type, or sex modulates gene regulatory evolution. Here, using wild-derived inbred lines of house mice collected from temperate and tropical environments, we determine the role of gene regulatory evolution in rapid, environmental adaptation.

significance: |
  Organisms rapidly adapt to new environments through changes in gene regulation. In particular, cis-regulatory changes have been shown to play major roles; however, understanding how the environment, tissue-type, or even sex modulates gene regulatory evolution is lacking.

Understanding how organisms adapt to new environments is a major goal of evolutionary biology. Gene regulation has been shown to play an important role in adaptation to new environments (or something about rapid adaptation). In fact, cis-regulated genes tend to be drivers of adaptation. However, many of these studies have only characterized cis/trans under one environmental context, or in one tissue, or just one sex. Gene regulation is highly context-dependent, and in order to fully understand the role of gene regulation in adaptation, need to investigate gene regulation in a complex manner.
Gene regulation plays an important role in environmental adaptation (Emerson and Li 2010; Signor and Nuzhdin 2018), with both cis- and trans-regulatory changes underlying evolved gene expression differences. While the evolutionary significance of gene regulation is well recognized, we have little understanding of how the environment, tissue-type, or sex influences the regulatory architecture of adaptive evolution. It has been well demonstrated that gene expression is highly dependent on the environment (Gibson 2008; Aubin-Horth and Renn 2009; Hodgins-Davis and Townsend 2009; Grishkevich and Yanai 2013), and that expression plasticity can facilitate or constrain adaptation to new environments (Ghalambor et al. 2007, 2015). Moreover, population genetic variation for plasticity (i.e., genotype-by-environment interactions, GxE) may constitute a large proportion of gene expression variation (Hodgins-Davis and Townsend 2009; Grishkevich and Yanai 2013), highlighting the important role the environment plays in the evolution of gene regulation. Yet, we still have little understanding of how plasticity in gene expression is regulated at the molecular level, leaving the question regarding the role of gene regulation in environmental adaptation unresolved.

patterns of gene regulation (intraspecific) between populations that have been diverged for awhile. Our study is of house mice that have only been diverged recently (rapid adaptation)
very few studies have looked at how environment mediates regulatory patterns, especially in endotherms
Few studies have characterized the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulation to environment-dependent gene expression (Signor and Nuzhdin 2018). In yeast and C. elegans, cis-acting changes in gene expression tend to be robust and insensitive to the environment (Li et al. 2006; Smith and Kruglyak 2008; Li and Fay 2017)), suggesting that most cis-regulatory divergence is not associated with expression plasticity. Conversely, trans effects tend to exhibit greater sensitivity to environmental change (Smith and Kruglyak 2008; Tirosh et al. 2009; Cubillos et al. 2014), and thus seem to play larger roles in regulating gene expression plasticity. Moreover, genetic variation for plasticity (GxE) tends to be modulated by trans effects (Grishkevich and Yanai 2013), likely due to the large mutational target of transcription factors (Landry et al. 2006, 2007; Grishkevich and Yanai 2013; Hill et al. 2020). Overall, investigations into these patterns have been taxonomically limited, with most studies conducted in yeast, C. elegans, and plants. Very few studies have investigated the gene regulatory basis of plasticity in natural populations (but see (Verta and Jones 2019; Tangwancharoen et al. 2020). Thus, relatively little is known about the regulatory architecture of plasticity and the contributions of cis and trans changes in expression plasticity underlying environmental adaptation.

House mice, Mus musculus domesticus, provide a unique opportunity to assess the environmental influence on gene regulation. House mice have rapidly adapted to various environments across the Americas, and gene regulation has been shown to play an important role in this process. For example, cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) associated with adaptive body size variation have been identified in populations of house mice along the east coast of North America (Mack et al. 2018; Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018). Moreover, house mice collected from desert and temperate environments show varying levels of gene expression plasticity, with differences in plasticity reflecting local adaptation (Bittner et al. 2021). These studies demonstrate the important role that gene regulation has played in the rapid colonization of house mice to various environments. However, it remains unclear how the environment influences the gene regulatory architecture of house mice and whether the relative contributions of cis and trans effects underly patterns of adaptive evolution in house mice.
House mice are perfect since theyâ€™ve recently adapted to varying thermal regimes. And gene regulation has been shown to play an important role in this adaptation. However, fully understanding how the environment modulates gene regulation, and the influence of tissue-type or sex is not well understood.

\end{figure*}

Here, we use two wild-derived inbred lines of house mice collected from climatically distinct environments to assess the influence of plasticity on gene regulation. Specifically, we use house mice collected from upstate New York and equatorial Brazil as they have rapidly adapted to climatically divergent environments. New York mice are larger with shorter extremities than Brazil mice, presumably reflecting adaptations to a cold environment (Ballinger and Nachman 2022; Figure 1). As phenotypic adaptation often involves changes in gene regulation OR To determine the regulatory mechanisms underlying these patterns of adaptation, we first characterize expression differences between New York and Brazil lines across two tissues, two temperatures, and both sexes. We next examine allele-specific expression (ASE) in F1 hybrids to characterize regulatory divergence between lines and identify the contributions of *cis* and *trans* changes to adaptive expression differences. We then explore the degree of plasticity in gene regulation by comparing cis- and trans-effects across temperatures. Lastly, we identify *cis*- and trans-by-environment interactions underlying genes that show patterns of adaptive plasticity. Overall, our findings highlight the role the environment plays in adaptive gene regulation in house mice.

While both liver and BAT both play essential roles in homeostasis and metabolism, these tissues have distinct functional properties that may lend differentially to their role in environmental adaptation.

We determine the role of gene regulation in rapid adaptation by characterizing gene expression patterns in wild-derived inbred lines of house mice that were collected from cold and warm environments. We expose these warm- and cold-adapted lines to warm and cold temperatures and determine the relative contributions of cis/trans across environments, tissues, and sexes. (Given that both New York and Brazil mice have adapted to divergent thermal environments, we reasoned that temperature-dependent gene regulation may play a role in local adaptation. We therefore asked how the environment modulates gene regulatory evolution). We also determine if cis-regulatory variations are under positive selection in wild mice collected from the warm and cold populations. We find that cis-regulatory changes are the predominant gene regulatory signature, highlighting the rapid evolution of cis. We also show that these cis-genes are robust to temperature and sex, and both tissues show the same pattern. Finally, we overlap these cis-regulated genes with PBSn1 outliers and identify regions of the genome that are associated with environmental adaptation.

Extensive divergence in gene expression between New York and Brazil mice {.unnumbered}
-------------------
As phenotypic variation is often associated with gene expression divergence, we first explored patterns of gene expression divergence by rearing New York (SARA) and Brazil (MANA) mice under two temperatures and sequenced <brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver transcriptomes of 48 individuals (6 x line x sex x environment; Figure 1C). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed tissue-type as the largest source of variance in transcriptional profiles (PC1 ~97% of variance explained; Figure S1), while sex explained the second-most variation (PC2 ~1.5%; Figure S1). Within each tissue and sex, mice separated by genotype along PC1 (>60% of variance explained), while PC3 largely separated warm- and cold-reared mice (Figures 1D and SX(males PC2 and females PC1-3)). Within a temperature regime, roughly 35% of the genes were differentially expressed between BZ and NY, with greater expression divergence in liver (X# of DEG or 34% of all expressed genes) compared to BAT (xK DEG or 37% of all expressed genes). Both temperature regimes within a tissue showed similar expression divergence. (expression differences are concordant across environments)

\begin{figure}[!t]

  \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{./figure_2.pdf}
  \caption{Gene expression patterns of New York and Brazil male house mice. Female-specific patterns are presented in Figure SX.}
\end{figure}

The strong patterns of divergence were also apparent when we categorized differentially expressed genes as those showing genetic variation (G), environmental variation [i.e., plasticity (E)], or genetic variation for plasticity (i.e., G x E) (Figure 2B; Figure SX), genotype explained the most variation, as the vast majority of differentially expressed genes in both tissues exhibited strong patterns of divergence, regardless of the environment (effect size of G >> effect size of E; Fig 2B; Figure SX (divergence expression)).
(BUT) BAT showed greater proportion of E genes compared to liver (diff effect sizes), highlighting the highly plastic nature of BAT (fig Sx - BAT plasticity) and overlal tissue-specific differences in gene expression plasticity.

Despite this strong signal of divergence, <percentage> of genes (XXX) and (XXX) showed genotype x environment interactions (GxE) in BAT and liver, respectively (Figures 2C and SX(females)).
(AND) Across both tissues, Brazil mice harbored more DEG than New York mice (Figure 3), with New York mice showing canalization of plasticity between environments (Figure 2). - also include volcano plot of DEG for each tissue?
(AND) Given the large number of plastic genes in Brazil, we next asked whether the plastic response of these genes correlated with expression divergence between New York and Brazil lines. Specifically, we asked if the logFC of Brazil warm and Brazil cold was positively correlated with the logFC of New York warm and Brazil warm.
(AND) Across both tissues, plasticity in Brazil was positively correlated with divergence, suggesting that overall patterns of expression plasticity in response to cold temperatures are adaptive. consistent with previous studies in house mice (Bittner et al. 2021).
(THEREFORE) Together, these results demonstrate that, while the majority of differentially expressed genes show strong patterns of divergence (expression differences are concordant across environments) across environments, a subset of genes show genotype-specific regulation in response to temperature (i.e., genetic variation for plasticity (GxE)).

### Genotype-by-Sex
Although males and females showed similar patterns of gene expression across tissues and environments, we did identify genotype x sex interactions for each tissue and environment separately (see Methods). Specifically, males harbored more DEG than females and RESULTS
Given the strong influences of both tissue and sex (see Figure SX), we performed downstream analyses for each tissue and sex separately. These results again demonstrate that divergence is playing a significant role, while tissue, sex, and environment specific effects play less roles.



Expression divergence is predominantly due to *cis*-regulatory changes, which are robust to environmental temperature {.unnumbered}
-------------------
To investigate the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying expression differences between New York and Brazil mice, we generated BAT and liver RNA-seq from New York (dam) x Brazil (sire) F1 hybrids that were also reared in warm or cold environments. Dominance of gene expression

Measuring gene expression in F1 hybrids allows us to discern if parental gene expression differences are due to cis- and/or trans-acting changes by assessing patterns of allele-specific expression (ASE): differences in expression between alleles are indicative of cis-regulatory divergence, while differences observed between parental lines but not in F1 hybrids are due to trans-acting variation. 

Overall, we detected a total of 5,898 genes with ASE based on the presence of fixed differences between parental Brazil and New York lines (see Methods), with both liver and BAT harboring similar numbers of gene underlying regulatory divergence (Figure 4). 
These results demonstrate that cis-regulatory evolution underlies divergence between wild mouse populations, consistent with previous studies in house mice (refs).


Given that both New York and Brazil mice have adapted to divergent thermal environments, we reasoned that temperature-dependent gene regulation may play a role in local adaptation. We therefore asked how the environment modulates gene regulatory evolution by comparing patterns of cis- and trans-regulatory differences across environments. Similar to differential expression patterns in the parents, the majority of genes showed the same gene regulatory patterns between environments (88%), suggesting that cis- and trans-effects play larger roles in expression divergence than that of plasticity. Moreover, when we compared the difference in magnitude of cis- and trans-differences between environments, we found that cis-regulatory changes were robust to environmental temperature while trans-differences were greater between environments for both tissues (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *P* > 0.05; Figure 4B,4D - effect sizes). We also found that the proportion of genes with only cis-divergence was the same across environmental temperatures (Chi-square tests: BAT, p=0.51; liver p=0.66), while the cold environment harbored a lower proportion of genes with trans-divergence (Chi-square tests: BAT, p=0.0003; liver, p=0.02). These results suggest that trans-effects are more sensitive to environmental condition, consistent with previous studies (refs).

\end{figure*}

Although most gene regulatory patterns are robust to environment, genes showing GxE patterns may be controlled by environment-specific regulation. To robustly identify genes for which there was a significant effect of temperature on regulatory divergence, we next asked if either the *cis* component and/or *trans* component showed a significant interaction with temperature. 

*Trans*-by-treatment identified for 19 genes in BAT and liver (Table XX)(FDR<0.1).  *Cis*-by-treatment/temperature effects were identified for 11 genes in BAT (gstt1, wars2, hsd11b1, itih5, dst, tmed2, plbd1, cdh13, scd1, tmem45b, s100a13) and 4 in the liver (elovl3, hmgcs2, wars2, ebpl) (FDR<0.1). Scd1 is a central lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and plays an important role in basal and cold-induced thermogenesis. Scd1 is required for maintaining body temperature under cold temperatures, and mice from New York show higher average expression of this under warm conditions in BAT than mice from Manaus. Elovl3 expression is also involved in the response to exposure to cold stress and mutants show defects in lipid recruitment in response to cold exposure. Where most of these are cases where allele-specific expression differs in magnitude between temperature treatments, we also observed cases where allelic-specific expression was induced by one temperature treatment (i.e., wars2, tmed2, cdh13, s100a13, ebpl, hmgcs2).

*Cis*-regulatory changes are largely tissue-biased and are related to body size and metabolism {.unnumbered}
----------------------

While both liver and BAT both play essential roles in homeostasis and metabolism, these tissues have distinct functional properties that may lend differentially to their role in environmental adaptation. Comparing gene expression evolution in BAT and liver, we found regulatory divergence to be largely tissue-biased. The majority of genes (80%) with evidence for regulatory divergence in at least one of the tissues were not categorized as having the same underlying regulatory divergence in the other tissue (2954/3672 genes). In particular, we found that *trans*- divergence was more likely to be restricted to one tissue (with expression conserved between populations in the other), compared to *cis*- changes which were more often shared (>2-fold more)(Chi-square test p<0.0001; Tables SX). This may reflect the general observation of increased tissue-specificity of trans-effects relative to cis-effects [15].
 
Contrasting allele-specific expression measurements in BAT and liver for paired hybrid samples, we identified 338 genes with evidence for differential allele-specific expression between tissues (Figure 3A). While the majority of these genes (77%) showed significant allele-specific expression in just one tissue, we also identified cases where allele-specific was present in both tissues but with differences in the magnitude or directionality (23%). Forty-three genes of these genes were found to have discordant allele-specific expression between tissues, where the opposite parental allele was up-regulated between tissues. Genes with tissue-biased ASE were enriched for metabolic phenotypes (e.g., abnormal lipid homeostasis, q=0.00027; increased food intake, q=0.036) and tissue specific functions and physiology (e.g., abnormal adipose tissue physiology, q=0.007; and abnormal liver morphology (q=0.00097).
<rerference petrov or pritchard, in which they're excited about cis-genes that are found in one tissue only>

Given that most regulatory divergence between New York and Brazil house mice is governed in cis, and because cis-regulatory variations are often drives of local adaptation (refs), we reasoned that genes with evidence for allele-specific expression between lines should be enriched for similar functional roles. In both the liver and BAT, genes with evidence for cis- divergence were enriched for GO terms related to metabolic processes, as well as the Reactome pathway for metabolism (Liver q=6.55 x10-8, BAT q=1.49 x 10-8) compared to the background set of genes that were tested for allele-specific expression. Genes with cis- regulatory changes in the liver were also enriched for several mutant phenotype annotations for homeostasis and metabolism, including abnormal lipid homeostasis (q= 6.248 x 10-5), abnormal cholesterol level (q=0.003), and abnormal energy expenditure (q=0.001), abnormal triglyceride level (q=0.008). Additionally, genes with cis- changes in the liver also showed a greater than 2-fold enrichment of genes with mutant phenotypes for abnormal susceptibility to weight gain (q=0.014), and were also nominally significantly enriched for several other phenotypes related to body weight, size, and composition (e.g., increased body size and weight, increased food intake, abnormal percent body fat/body weight, decreased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity) (Table SXX). Among these are genes (i.e., bcat2, adam17) for which expression levels in the liver and *cis*-eQTL were previously associated with body mass variation in wild populations of North American house mice [14] as well as genes with well-documented roles in body weight variation other species (e.g., lepr, fads2, bbs1, prkar2b). These results further support the strong divergence in body size we see between NY and BZ mice, as body size is canalized and shows no plasticity (Figure SX).

Selection on genes with cis-regulatory divergence in wild house mouse populations {.unnumbered}
------

To understand regulatory divergence between these lines in the context of genetic divergence between populations from these localities, we analyzed population genomic data from wild-caught individuals. We compared complete exomes sequenced at moderate coverage for 18 individuals captured in New Hampshire/Vermont (10 individuals)(NH/VT)(cite megan) and Manaus (8 individuals).

Genetic PCA clearly distinguished populations based on geography. Mice from the Americas were compared to previously published population genomic data from Eurasian populations of M. domesticus (cite Harr)(Figure 4). LD-pruned genotype data clustered all individuals by subspecies and M. m. domesticus by population-of-origin (Figure SX). Consistent with the suggestion that mice from eastern North America are most closely related to populations in northern Europe, mice from NH/VT clustered most closely with mice from Germany (cite Tichy et al. 1994, Morgan et al. BioRxiv paper). 

To identify genetic signatures of adaptation in house mice from the Americas, we performed a scan for regions of genetic differentiation consistent with selection using a normalized version of the population branch statistic (PBSn1). PBSn1 captures loci where allele frequencies are especially differentiated in a focal population when compared with two other populations (Yi et al. 2010; Crawford et al. 2017). We used this test to identify highly differentiated loci in our focal populations in the Americas, Manaus and New York, relative to Eurasian populations (see Methods). In total, 83,538 and 84,420 non-overlapping five-SNP windows were analyzed for Manaus and NH/VT, respectively. We considered windows as outliers if they fell within the top 1% of windows for PBSn1 score. Outlier windows in NH/VT and Manaus overlapped 538 and 530 genes, respectively (File SX).

<Justification for looking at cis- overlap.> Next, we overlapped candidate regions for selection based on PBSn1 outlier windows with genes for which we identified evidence for cis- regulatory changes in BAT or the liver. In NH/VT, we identified 99 outlier windows that overlapped 64 genes with evidence for cis- regulatory divergence (Figure 4). These genes were enriched for mutant phenotypes related body size and growth relative to other genes with cis- divergence between populations: (1) growth/size/body region phenotype (q=0.008; 1.74-fold enrichment, 30 genes), (2) abnormal postnatal growth/weight/body size (q=0.026; 1.97-fold enrichment, 23 genes), and (3) abnormal body composition (q=0.05; 2-fold enrichment, 18 genes).  This set included genes whose expression in the liver was previously associated with body mass variation in natural populations of North American house mice (bcat2, col6a1, col5a2, col3a1). Additionally, this set included genes implicated in obesity and metabolic phenotypes in humans (e.g., wrn, plaat3, prkar2b, sulf2, smoc1) . In Manaus, we identified an overlap of 68 outlier windows overlapping 37 genes with evidence for cis- regulatory divergence (Figure SX). These genes were enriched for homeostasis/metabolism phenotypes (q=0.04, 1.62-fold enrichment, 20 genes) and as well as several non-metabolic phenotypes (e.g., integument phenotype, abnormal locomotor activation) relative to a background of genes with evidence for cis- divergence.

For the NH/VT comparison, we found that the overlap between genes with cis- regulatory divergence and outlier windows was greater than expected by chance (hypergeometric test, p=0.0017, 1.45-fold enrichment), where we do not observe this enrichment for Manaus (p=0.16). Additionally, genes with evidence for cis- regulatory divergence showed higher average PBSn1 than other genes when NH/VT is a focal population (Permutation test, p<0.00005), but not when Manaus was a focal population (p=0.91). 

Discussion {.unnumbered}
========================================

Understanding how both genetic and environmental variation influence gene regulation is essential to understanding adaptive evolution. Here, we utilized allele-specific expression to characterize cis and trans changes underlying divergence and plasticity in temperate and tropical house mice. We found that the majority of gene expression differences showed concordant patterns of regulatory divergence across environments, suggesting that genetic effects are more pervasive than environmental effects. In particular, we found that most regulatory divergence was underlined by cis-regulatory variation, and that these cis-effects were highly independent of temperature. These results are consistent with previous studies in yeast (Smith and Kruglyak 2008; Tirosh et al. 2009; Naranjo et al. 2015); (Li et al. 2006); (Chen et al. 2015); (Cubillos et al. 2014) in which most concordant expression differences across environments are controlled by conserved cis effects. Moreover, the universal patterns in the stability of cis-regulatory variation further illustrates the significance of cis-acting factors in adaptive evolution (Wittkopp et al. 2008; Emerson et al. 2010; Massouras et al. 2012; Tung et al. 2015; Verta and Jones 2019). Overall, our results demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation plays a significant role in the divergence of North and South American house mice.

## Rapid divergence of introduced populations of house mice
These results highlight that divergence is a major axis of expression variation in house mice.
Divergence between subspecies (Mack et al. 2016) resulted in about 9K fixed SNPS.
Here, almost 6K fixed SNPs.

Changes in the environment preferentially impacted trans-regulation profiles in house mice compared to cis-regulation (Tables 1 and 2; Figure 2), suggesting that trans-effects play a more pronounced role in gene expression plasticity. Greater sensitivity of trans-effects to the environment is in strong agreement with previous studies in yeast (Smith and Kruglyak 2008; Tirosh et al. 2009; Naranjo et al. 2015), nematodes (Li et al. 2006), flies (Chen et al. 2015), and plants (Cubillos et al. 2014). The generality of trans-effects being more sensitive across environmental conditions may be due to the role trans-acting factors play in signaling pathways that become activated in response to environmental change (Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016). Moreovoer, the large mutational target space of trans-regulatory variants make them much more pleiotropic than cis effects (Denver et al. 2005; Landry et al. 2007), allowing them to impact the regulation of many genes that are contingent upon an environmental stimulus (Promislow 2005). Indeed, we found that the effect sizes of trans were greater than that of cis across both tissues in house mice (Figure S4), suggesting that much of expression plasticity we observed is governed by changes in trans.

Gene regulation is not only dependent on environmental conditions but it is also tissue specific (GTEx). Although both liver and BAT exhibited similar levels of cis- and trans-regulatory variation across enviornments (Table 1), we did observe more cis- and trans-by-temperature effects in BAT compared to liver (Table S1). These patterns may reflect the developmentally plastic nature of BAT in response to cold temperatures (Cannon and Nedergaard 2004). Alternatively, these patterns may reflect differences in pleiotropy or tissue-specificity. For example, threespine sticklebacks show a preponderance of both cis (Verta and Jones 2019) and trans (Hart et al. 2018) regulation underlying parallel environmental adaptation. The discrepancies between the two studies are likely a result of differences in tissues analyzed, as the genetic architectures of simple and complex tissues differ from the effect of heterogeneity (Hart et al. 2018; Verta and Jones 2019). Similar influences may be contributing to differences seen between BAT and liver. For example, BAT is a more heterogeneous tissue than the liver, with varying levels of lipid droplets and mitochondria (Ikeda et al. 2018; Oguri and Kajimura 2020). Moreover, the greater proportion of trans-by-temperature effects in BAT compared to the liver may be indicative of BAT being more specialized and pleiotropic, especially in terms of plasticity. Overall, these results highlight the importance of investigating the effects of gene regulation across multiple tissues.

Finally, the role of expression plasticity in facilitating or constraining adaptation has received considerable attention in the last few years (Ghalambor et al. 2015; Velotta et al. 2018; Campbell-Staton et al. 2021; Josephs et al. 2021). Although numerous studies have identified roles for both adaptive and non-adaptive expression plasticity, very few studies have characterized the underlying regulatory architecture of such patterns (He et al. 2021). We overlapped cis- and trans-by-temperature candidates with patterns of adaptive plasticity previously identified (Ballinger and Nachman, in prep) and found that genes exhibiting adaptive plasticity are underlined by both cis-by-treatment and trans-by-treatment effects (Figure 3). Interestingly, most genes exhibiting adaptive plasticity are constitutively expressed across warm and cold environments in New York mice. Although we do not have direct evidence for genetic assimilation (Waddington 1952, 1953; Crispo 2007), these candidates illustrate the potential regulatory mechanisms underlying genetic assimilation. For example, cis regulatory variants could rapidly canalize expression through the loss or gain of specific binding sites for conditionally expressed transcription factors, thereby decoupling a geneâ€™s expression from the environment (Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016). Alternatively, trans effects could activate environmentally-sensitive signaling pathways in the absence of an environmental cue, causing a geneâ€™s expression to be constitutively expressed (Yvert et al. 2003; Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016). However, these hypotheses do not consider the effects of gene regulatory networks nor identify causal mutations of candidate genes. Thus, future work is needed to identify causal mutations underlying adaptive plasticity and genetic assimilation (Corl et al. 2018; van der Burg et al. 2020). Regardless, these are exciting candidates for further investigation into the molecular and regulatory underpinnings of adaptive plasticity in house mice.

### Animals and experimental design {#mice .unnumbered}

We used two wild-derived inbred lines of house mice collected from upstate New York (SARA) and equatorial Brazil (MANA). The establishment of these lines and the experimental design implemented in this study have been described previously (Ballinger and Nachman, 2022). Briefly, we generated F1 hybrids by crossing a New York female with a Brazil male. All experimental animals were born at room temperature (20oC). We weaned and singly housed SARA, MANA, and F1 hybrids at ~3 weeks of age. We split 3.5-week-old full-sibs and F1 hybrids into size-matched experimental groups across cold (5oC) and warm (21oC) treatments. Mice were kept in their respective experimental environment up until ~12 weeks of age, at which point individuals were euthanized via cervical dislocation. We took standard museum measurements and then rapidly dissected and preserved liver and brown adipose tissue in RNAlater at 4oC overnight and moved to -80oC until RNA extraction. Skins were removed and dried for subsequent thermal conductance measruements (ref; see SI methods). All experimental procedures were in accordance with the UC Berkeley Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP-2017-08-10248). Food and water were provided *ad libitum*.

### RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing {#rna-extraction-library-preparation-and-sequencing .unnumbered}

We extracted total RNA from both liver and BAT from each sample (n = ~6 per genotype/sex/treatment/tissue) using the RNeasy PowerLyzer Kit (QIAGEN). We generated Illumina cDNA libraries from 1 ug of purified RNA using KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit (Illumina), and uniquely indexed libraries using unique dual indexes (Illumina). Libraries were pooled in equal molar concentration and sequenced on one lane each of 150 bp paired-end NovaSeq S1 and NovaSeq S4 at the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Center at UC Berkeley. We filtered raw reads below a Phred quality score of 15 and trimmed adapter sequences using fastp (Chen et al. 2018).

### Parental gene expression analyses {#parental-gene-expression-analyses .unnumbered}

After cleaning and trimming parental sequences of MANA and SARA, we mapped reads to the Mus musculus reference genome (GRCm38/mm10) using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013). We counted reads overlapping exons using HTSeq (Anders et al. 2015) based on the Ensembl GRCm38.98 annotation. After pre-processing and filtering, we retained >14K genes for downstream analyses. We detected ~14K expressed genes that were shared across all samples (XXX for warm-reared mice, XXX for cold-reared mice; normalized counts â€“ 10 reads per gene across all samples in each tissue separately). We imported raw count data into R (v.4.1) and used DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) to quantify expression patterns by fitting a generalized linear model following a negative binomial distribution. First, we determined effects of genotype, environment, and genotype-by-environment on expression patterns between lines for each tissue separately. We then computed differential expression between lines with the model population + environment + population*environment. We removed genes with a mean fewer than 10 reads across samples per tissue. Lastly, we used a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) on the resulting P-values and considered genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) smaller than 0.05 to be significantly differentially expressed.


### Identifying variants between parental lines {#identifying-variants-between-parental-lines .unnumbered}

To identify differences between lines for allele-specific read assignment, SNP calling was performed on whole genome sequence data from one female each of MANA and SARA. Genomic reads were mapped with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) to the mm10 reference genome (setting: --very-sensitive) obtained from Ensembl. Duplicates were marked with the Picard tool MarkDuplicates and then the GATK tools HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs were used for joint genotyping across genomic samples. We filtered for low quality SNP calls with VariantFiltration (QD < 2.0; QUAL < 30.0; FS > 200; ReadPosRankSum < -20.0). To reduce the influence of genotyping error on allele-specific expression, we mapped RNAseq reads from all individuals and then counted allele-specific reads aligned to each site we genotyped with the GATK tool ASEReadCounter. Sites for which we did not have coverage of at least 5 reads from each population-specific allele were excluded. These SNPs were then used for identifying allele-specific reads.


### Mapping allele-specific reads {#mapping-allele-specific-reads .unnumbered}

For allele-specific expression analyses, reads from hybrid individuals were mapped to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38/mm10) using STAR. We used WASP (van de Geijn et al. 2015) to reduce the potential for reference mapping bias. Reads that overlapped a population-specific variant and that passed WASP filtering were retained for our allele-specific expression analysis. Reads overlapping informative variants were separated into allele-specific pools (NY, BR) based on genotype for quantification. We used HTSeq to count the number of reads associated with each gene per population based on the overlap of reads and annotated exonic regions based on the Ensembl GRCm38.98 annotation. We examined per site allelic reads with ASEReadCounter to quantify read mapping bias. Proportions of reads overlapping the references vs. alternative allele (REF allele / (ALT allele + REF allele)) show a median 0.5 across samples (Figure S5). Consequently, we do not find evidence for reference mapping bias. Overall, a total of 5,861 genes were tested for allele-specific expression based on the presence of fixed differences between Brazil (MANA) and New York (SARA) lines.

### Identifying cis- and trans- divergence {#identifying-cis-and-trans-divergene .unnumbered}

To characterize regulatory divergence in warm and cold temperature treatments, we compared expression in Brazil and New York lines (F0 generation) with differences in expression in alleles in a hybrid (F1 generation). Differential expression between alleles in hybrids is evidence for cis- regulatory divergence, where differences in the ratio of expression between alleles in a hybrid and between genes in the F0 generation are evidence for trans divergence.
Differential expression in the F0 generation (parents) was inferred by analyzing raw counts using the DESeq2 package (see above). To identify genes with evidence of allelic imbalance in hybrid individuals, we took reads that mapped preferentially to either New York or Brazil alleles and fit these to a model with allele (NY vs. BZ), sample (individual), and tissue (BAT, liver) for hybrid male samples (~temperature + individual:temperature + allele:temperature) in DESeq2. The trans component was assessed through a Fisherâ€™s Exact Test on reads mapping to each parental allele in the hybrid versus parental read counts, summed over all replicates. We randomly down-sampled to account for library size differences between parental and F1 replicates. P-values for each test were corrected for false-discovery rate with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Tests with FDR < 0.05 were considered significant.
Genes with differences in expression between alleles in the hybrid and expression in the F0 generation and without a difference between these ratios (via the Fisherâ€™s Exact Test) were considered divergent in cis alone. Genes without allele-specific expression in hybrids but differential expression in the F0 generation and a significant difference in these ratios were considered divergent in trans alone. Cases where we identified a significant trans component and divergence in either alleles in the hybrid or expression in the F0 generation were indicative of cis and trans divergence together.
